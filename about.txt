Trying to create my own chess program, building from scratch. So far I have a 
working chess board that keeps track of all active peices. The elimination of 
peices works and moves them to the eliminated list. Also the program checks all
moves to see if the location specified is on the board and rejects if it is not.


-Current goal
Currently working on breaking large functions down and optimizing them.

-Next in line
Print a prompt if a peice gets eliminated.
Sorting the eliminated peices and grouping them by color.
Checking to see if player moves are legal.
